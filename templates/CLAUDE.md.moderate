# IBR UI Verification

## When to Use IBR

Run `npx ibr audit <url>` when:
- Building or editing interactive components (buttons, forms, links)
- User reports something "doesn't work" or is "broken"
- Before marking UI work complete
- After editing files in `components/**`, `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Audit a page for issues
npx ibr audit http://localhost:3000

# Interactive session (for pages requiring user input)
npx ibr session:start http://localhost:3000
npx ibr session:type <id> "input" "search text"
npx ibr session:click <id> "button[type=submit]"
npx ibr session:screenshot <id>

# Check what was captured
npx ibr list
```

## What IBR Detects

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| NO_HANDLER | Button without click handler |
| PLACEHOLDER_LINK | Link with `href="#"` and no handler |
| TOUCH_TARGET_SMALL | Element below 44px (mobile) or 24px (desktop) |
| MISSING_ARIA_LABEL | Interactive element without accessible label |

## Recommended Workflow

1. Make UI changes
2. Run `npx ibr audit <url>`
3. If errors: fix and re-run
4. If clean: proceed to completion

## Trigger Keywords

Consider using IBR when task mentions:
- UI, button, form, component, layout, design
- "doesn't work", "broken", "not clickable"
- interactive, click handler, navigation
