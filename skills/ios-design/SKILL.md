# iOS Design

HIG-derived rules plus lessons from real apps (FloDoro, SpeakSavvy-iOS). Research context: `docs/research/2026-04-13-mobile-ui-best-practices.md`.

## Navigation

- **Tab bar**: 3–5 mutually exclusive top-level areas; never actions. iOS 26 tab bars float as Liquid Glass capsules
- **NavigationStack** (not deprecated NavigationView) for hierarchical drill-down
- **Toolbar**: contextual actions for current view; distinct from tab bar
- **Modal** (`.sheet`, `.fullScreenCover`): only for tasks that must complete or cancel
- Large titles (`.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.large)`) collapse inline on scroll — standard for top-level screens

## Colors

- Use `Color.accentColor` / `tintColor` for interactivity — never hardcoded blue
- `Color(.systemBackground)`, `Color(.label)`, `Color(.secondaryLabel)`, `Color(.separator)` for hierarchy
- Four label levels: primary / secondary / tertiary / quaternary — match to hierarchy tier
- Fill colors: `.systemFill` → `.quaternarySystemFill` for overlays
- Never hardcode hex that needs to survive dark mode or accessibility contrast

## Typography

- `.font(.body)`, `.title`, `.headline` — not `.system(size: 17)`
- Body default = 17pt SF Pro; SF Pro auto-switches Display ≥20pt, Text ≤19pt
- **Dynamic Type**: support xSmall → xxxLarge (7 standard) + AX1–AX5 (5 accessibility, up to ~310% scale). Test AX3+ — layouts must reflow, not clip
- `@Environment(\.dynamicTypeSize)` to react

## SF Symbols

Use SF Symbols for every system icon. They auto-scale with Dynamic Type, auto-tint with accent, have filled/circle/square/slash variants, and ship with the OS — no image assets needed.

## Touch targets

**44×44 pt minimum** for every interactive element. Applies even on curved watch edges and under Live Activities.

## Haptics

- `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`: `.light` / `.medium` / `.heavy` / `.soft` / `.rigid` — match weight to visual weight
- `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator`: `.success` / `.warning` / `.error` — only for task outcomes
- `UISelectionFeedbackGenerator`: discrete value changes (pickers)
- Don't overuse; don't retain generators long-term (Taptic Engine idle state affects battery)

## Dark mode + materials

- Semantic colors adapt automatically — test both appearances
- SwiftUI materials: `.ultraThinMaterial` → `.thickMaterial`
- **iOS 26 Liquid Glass**: new translucent material system with real-time reflection/refraction. Verify exact SwiftUI modifier names against live Xcode docs before quoting

## Dynamic Island + Live Activities

- Three states: compact / minimal / expanded
- Content must be concentric with the pill shape (rounded inner margins)
- Dynamic payload ≤ **4 KB**
- Use relevance score when multiple activities compete
- **Lesson from FloDoro**: paused activities set `staleDate` to `.distantFuture` so they don't disappear

## Dynamic Type + VoiceOver

- Every interactive element: `accessibilityLabel` + `accessibilityHint` when purpose isn't obvious
- Test with VoiceOver on — trap focus is a bug
- Rotor support where appropriate

## SwiftData + CloudKit gotchas (from FloDoro)

- **Do NOT** use `@Attribute(.unique)` — CloudKit fails silently
- **Do NOT** require non-optional properties without defaults — CloudKit fails silently
- Lightweight migration only; append-only session records for timer/workout state
- Raw runtime state stays device-local — only sync persistent records
- iCloud "Data on iCloud" toggle-off can delete local data — warn user + keep local backup

## WatchConnectivity (if watchOS target)

Use WCSession for iOS ↔ watchOS sync. iPhone acts as bridge — no direct Mac ↔ Watch connection. Channel selection and implementation patterns are in apple-platform.

## Speech API (iOS 26+) — lessons from SpeakSavvy-iOS

- Prefer `SpeechAnalyzer` if asset installed — check via `AssetInventory.status(forModules:) == .installed`
- Fall back to `SFSpeechRecognizer` if model unavailable
- **CRITICAL**: enable `.transcriptionConfidence` in `SpeechTranscriber.attributeOptions` to populate per-word confidence — without it, segmentConfidences is empty (incident INC_DEPENDENCY_20260407)
- **Never** feed raw `audioEngine.inputNode.outputFormat` to SpeechAnalyzer without format negotiation — causes SIGTRAP in preRunRecognition

## HealthKit essentials (from FloDoro)

- Parallel fetches with `async let` task groups
- Baseline cache (HR, HRV) pre-session; aggregate queries post-session
- Register `HKWorkoutSession` during focus/workout sessions
- macOS compiles as empty (no HealthKit) — isolate with `#if os(iOS)` or `#if !os(macOS)`

- [Signing & Capabilities workflow](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/en.lproj/dev60b6fbbc7.html)

**Lesson (from SpeakSavvy-iOS):** Use xcodebuild with `authenticationKeyPath`, `keyID`, `issuerID` for automated signing — no interactive Xcode GUI needed. Xcode 26.0+ required for iOS 26 features; check `SpeechAnalyzer` availability at runtime to gracefully degrade on older devices.

## Anti-patterns

- Hardcoded font sizes → breaks Dynamic Type
- Hardcoded colors → breaks dark mode + accessibility
- Missing VoiceOver labels on icon buttons
- Modal sheets for non-interrupting content
- Retaining haptic generators long-term
- SwiftData `@Attribute(.unique)` with CloudKit
- Feeding raw audio format to SpeechAnalyzer without negotiation
